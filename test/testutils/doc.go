// Package testutils provides utility functions to aid in testing, especially for file handling and multipart form creation.
// This package includes helper functions to create test files and generate multipart forms containing those files,
// which can be used in unit tests or integration tests to simulate file uploads and other file-based interactions.
// It also helps with cleanup by ensuring files created during tests are properly removed after the tests run.
