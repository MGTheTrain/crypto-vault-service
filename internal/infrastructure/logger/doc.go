// Package logger provides an abstraction layer for logging with configurable loggers that output to either the console
// or to log files. It supports log levels such as Info, Warn, Error, Fatal and Panic, and offers a singleton pattern
// for the logger instance to ensure efficient and thread-safe logging across the application.
