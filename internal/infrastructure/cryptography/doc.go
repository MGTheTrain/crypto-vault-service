// Package cryptography provides various interfaces and implementations for cryptographic operations.
// It includes functionalities for encryption, decryption, key generation and signing/verification using different
// cryptographic algorithms like AES, RSA and Elliptic Curve (EC). The package also supports hardware-based cryptographic
// operations via PKCS#11 tokens, allowing interaction with hardware security modules (HSMs) or smart cards.
