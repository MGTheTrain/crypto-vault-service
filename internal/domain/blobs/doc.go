// Package blobs defines the core interfaces and repository operations for handling blob-related operations.
// It provides functionality for uploading, retrieving, deleting, and managing blobs and their metadata.
// The interfaces support services for uploading, downloading, and managing blob metadata, while the repository
// interfaces abstract the persistence layer for interacting with the blob data.
